# Deployment

- A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

- You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.

- Note: Do not manage ReplicaSets owned by a Deployment.

## Use Case

- The following are typical use cases for Deployments:

- [Create a Deployment to rollout a ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#creating-a-deployment). The ReplicaSet creates Pods in the background. Check the status of the rollout to see if it succeeds or not.

- [Declare the new state of the Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#updating-a-deployment) by updating the PodTemplateSpec of the Deployment. A new ReplicaSet is created and the Deployment manages moving the Pods from the old ReplicaSet to the new one at a controlled rate. Each new ReplicaSet updates the revision of the Deployment.

- [Rollback to an earlier Deployment revision](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#rolling-back-a-deployment) if the current state of the Deployment is not stable. Each rollback updates the revision of the Deployment.

- [Scale up the Deployment to facilitate more load](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#scaling-a-deployment).

- [Pause the rollout of a Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#pausing-and-resuming-a-deployment) to apply multiple fixes to its PodTemplateSpec and then resume it to start a new rollout.

- [Use the status of the Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#deployment-status) as an indicator that a rollout has stuck.

- [Clean up older ReplicaSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#clean-up-policy) that you don't need anymore.

```shell
# Create the Deployment by running the following command:
k apply -f deployment-1.yaml

# Run kubectl get deployments to check if the Deployment was created.
k get deployments

# Run the following to check if the Deployment, ReplicaSet, Pods were created.
k get all

# View the rollout history of a deployment
kubectl rollout history deployment/abc

# View the details of daemonset revision 3
kubectl rollout history daemonset/abc --revision=3

# Usage:
kubectl rollout history (TYPE NAME | TYPE/NAME) [flags] [options]

```
